* i think we need to get rid of all the wild cards altogether
* when we return the failed line, we return the failure before fancy card count
* highlight cards that have copies greater than 60?  30?


* parse all decks, putting non-matched cards into a giant hash table iwth a count
* red-flag all the resulting strategy text and deck / author text.  drop description
* New SWCCGCarg that is "unknown" which we create, that only has the text that is unclear




* How to handle cards with the same name?  IE which Boba Fett?

* Pass context while parsing the card name:
    Starting
    Effect/Interrupt/Starship category?
